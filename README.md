# ESPAT S2S
This is a space to organize efforts around improving S2S predictability as part of NSF NCAR's ESPAT initiative, with an initial focus on land-atmosphere interactions. 

# Issues
Open a new issue to create a new action item/task to be accomplished as part of the S2S core projects. You can add or create tags as relevent; please tag a certain model if it the task is only relevant to that model. 

# Discussion
Create or add to a discussion, which will work similarly to an email thread (but open to all to review/comment). 

# Wiki
See the wiki for details on setting up new simulations (including the forcings, resolution, model version, etc. to ensure consistency across runs unless explicitly stated otherwise), meeting notes, etc. 

# Code of Conduct
We are committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive community for all participants.
