## What to include in your README (README.md)
Once you copy over this template and choose your license, you should populate your README file. This file serves as a landing page for your repository and should provide the following:
- Title of the project
- Introduction and overview of what the analysis covers
- How to contribute
- How to reproduce the conda environment

An example of this is given below
```
# Climate-Analysis

"git checkout -b <nameofyourbranch>"


## Reproducing the environment

"conda env create -f envs/environment.yml"
"conda activate environment_name"


```

## The importance of software citation and minting a DOI
Once your repository is built and you have added your analysis, you may want to mint a DOI for your project, so you can share your work with the community AND receive credit for doing so.

Directions on how to mint a DOI for your project can be found on the [NCAR Software Citation Documentation](https://ncar.github.io/software-citation/pages/recommendation/mint-doi.html)
